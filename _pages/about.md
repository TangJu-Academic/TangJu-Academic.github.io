I completed my undergraduate and master's degrees at Beihang University, majoring in Aerospace Science and Technology with a focus on multiscale heat and mass transfer, under the supervision of [Prof. Dongsheng Wen](https://www.epc.ed.tum.de/en/td/staff/wen/) and [Prof. Jin Zhao](https://shi.buaa.edu.cn/zhaojin/en/index.htm).

In the course of my master's studies, the primary focus of my research was on the domain of heat and mass transfer at micro/nano and macro scales, with a foundation in molecular dynamics simulations. The present study investigates the influence of thermal/mechanical/chemical properties at material surfaces on thermal protection, examining materials such as carbon knitted structures, phenolic resin composites, and hydrogels.
